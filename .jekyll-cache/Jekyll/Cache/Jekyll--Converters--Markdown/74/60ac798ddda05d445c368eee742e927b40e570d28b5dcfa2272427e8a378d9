I"c<p>Lately my APC Back-UPS ES 700 was crippled by the problem that seems to kill most of itâ€™s models: after a surge event, instead of switching to battery it starts to continuously beep. For a while I could restart it several times and the problem would go away, but in the past few days nothing would make it turn on again without constant beeping.</p>

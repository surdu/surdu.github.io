<p>The documentation is very slim when it talks about <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/django-admin/#running-management-commands-from-your-code">how to call a Django command from code</a>. In order to do this, just use <code class="highlighter-rouge">call_command</code>. To solve the trick of capturing the output of this I had to dig a little into the Django source.</p>

<p>The solution to capturing the output of the command being called is passing to <code class="highlighter-rouge">call_command</code> an argument called <code class="highlighter-rouge">stdout</code> to which you assign where the output is written (a file or any bite stream). Here is an example:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/surdu/5db721a9970b3e59af82af932d73c4d1.js"></script>

<p>In the above example we call <code class="highlighter-rouge">python manage.py dumpdata</code>, which will output all the data from all the models in all the installed apps from the current project in form of a JSON.</p>

<p>Hope it helps ðŸ˜‰</p>

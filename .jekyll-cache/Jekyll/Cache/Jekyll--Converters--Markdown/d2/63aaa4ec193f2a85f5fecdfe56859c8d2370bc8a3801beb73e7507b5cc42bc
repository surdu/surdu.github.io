I"<<p>I have a server at my home on which I host various test projects and I needed a dynamic DNS service as my ISP assigns me an IP dynamically. Tried some dynamic DNS services, but their domain names tend to get long, and I donâ€™t like typing URLS. So I decided to buy a domain and handle the DNS update myself.</p>

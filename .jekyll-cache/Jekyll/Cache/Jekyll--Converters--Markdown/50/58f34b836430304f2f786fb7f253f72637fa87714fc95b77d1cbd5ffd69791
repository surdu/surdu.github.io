I"›<p>So, you want to render a route on your OpenLayers map. Everything will be nice and sweet until youâ€™ll have to render a huge route, in which case no matter what computer your clients have, most probably it will stall. To solve this you have two possibilities: you either reduce the number of lines you send from the server or you reduce the number of points rendered directly on the clientâ€™s browser.</p>

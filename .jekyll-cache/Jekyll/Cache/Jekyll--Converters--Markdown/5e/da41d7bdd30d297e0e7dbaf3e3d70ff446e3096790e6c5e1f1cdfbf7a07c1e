I"§	<p>Lately my APC Back-UPS ES 700 was crippled by the problem that seems to kill most of itâ€™s models: after a surge event, instead of switching to battery it starts to continuously beep. For a while I could restart it several times and the problem would go away, but in the past few days nothing would make it turn on again without constant beeping.</p>

<p>First of all, you should eliminate that the beeping is not caused by a normal condition. Please check the <a href="/assets/images/apc/manual.pdf">user manualâ€™s</a> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Status Indicators</code> section for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Constant tone</code> audible indication.</p>

<p>If itâ€™s not a normal condition, itâ€™s time to take it apart.</p>

<p>Before disconnecting the main board, it would be a good idea to take a picture of itâ€™s connections, as there are plenty of them:</p>

<p>After a quick visual inspection of the main board it was clear that no parts where blown. Next I checked on a hint from a YouTube comment, that someone was successful in fixing it by replacing some bad capacitors, but he/she didnâ€™t go into any more detail than that.</p>

<p>Time to take out the <a href="http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/5uSjWch2">ESR Meter</a>. This will allow us to determine if a capacitor might be bad without taking it out of the circuit.</p>

<p>Measured all capacitors and sure enough, found 4 caps that where dead as a dodo. Iâ€™ve circled them in red in the following picture.</p>

<p><em>Note: the capacitors in the picture are already changed. Yours will look different, probably like the ones in the picture below.</em></p>

<p>All 4 bad caps where the same: capacitance <code class="highlighter-rouge">22uF</code> and voltage rating of <code class="highlighter-rouge">25V</code> made by Jamicon.</p>

<p>I replaced mine with better quality <a href="http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_soNn0C">Nichicon capacitors</a> as I didnâ€™t wanted to replace them again anytime soon.</p>

<p>After putting it back together I realized that this also fixed another problem: for as far as I can remember, like 5 seconds after starting the UPS, it started buzzing loudly for a while. Now you can barely hear the buzzing.</p>

<p>Hope this helps ðŸ˜Ž</p>

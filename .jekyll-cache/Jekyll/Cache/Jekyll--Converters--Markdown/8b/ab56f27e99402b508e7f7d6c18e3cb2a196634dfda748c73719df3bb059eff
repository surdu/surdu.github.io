I"‚<p>As you may have figured by now, Django does not implement such a feature. That is, because the logic of setting the variable must go in the view, not in the template. But there are some rare cases when you actually need this.</p>

<p>The way you can solve this is by using a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/custom-template-tags/#writing-custom-template-tags">custom Django template tag</a>.</p>

<p>To do this, you create a file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">set_var.py</code> in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/custom-template-tags/#code-layout">your <code class="highlighter-rouge">templatetags</code> folder</a> that contains the following code:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/surdu/c9970da44dcaef6b18fee40dfcbabcd3.js"></script>

<p>Then to use this in your template, you just do the following:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/surdu/fe0e1b48661541d29156798be462f428.js"></script>

<p>As you can see, you can put in your variables anything that you could normally get inside a Django template: a number, another context variable, a string, etc.</p>

<p>Hope it helps ðŸ˜‰</p>

I"»<p>When working with CSS you sometimes have to work around a behaviour known as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing">margin collapsing</a>. Basically, the top/bottom margin of two neighboring block elements will be set to the biggest margin value in-between the two elements, if their top/bottom margins are adjacent and no text, clearance, padding nor border separate them.</p>
